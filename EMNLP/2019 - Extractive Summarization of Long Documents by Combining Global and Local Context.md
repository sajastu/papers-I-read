## Extractive Summarization of Long Documents by Combining Global and Local Context, EMNLP 2019

###### Overview
saas
  - proposing a novel neural singledocument extractive summarization model for
    long documents, incorporating both the global
    context of the whole document and the local
    context within the current topic.
  - Evaluating the model on two scientific datasets: 1) ArXiv and PubSum.
  - focus of this paper is on extracting informative
    sentences from a given document (without dealing
    with redundancy), especially when the document
    is relatively long (e.g., scientific articles).
  - Long documents generally follow a discourse structure. 
  - Contributions:
    - The first to apply LSTM-minus to text summarization.
